    <h1>Setting up Slack (guidelines for accompanying adults)</h1>
    <p>Please follow the guidelines below to set up your profile to enable your child to use Slack safely during the workshop. This Slack group will be deleted at the end of the workshop.</p>
    <br>
  </header>

  <div id="intro" class="left">
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#name">Change your name to the first name & initial of your child</a></li>
      <li><a href="#picture">Use no profile picture, or an appropriate non-identifying one</a></li>
      <li><a href="#notifications">Disable email notifications (if you do not do this, you will receive many emails during the day!)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Any settings you change will be unique to this Slack group, so do not worry if you also use Slack e.g. for work.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Once you have completed the set-up, please log out of Slack on shared computers and do not allow your child to use it unaccompanied. It will not be fully monitored until the day of the workshop.</strong></p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="access" class="left">
    <h3>Accessing the workspace</h3>
    <p>You will receive an email invitation to join the Slack workspace.</p>
    <p>After clicking the link, <strong>use this same email address</strong> to create an account for Slack (or to log in if you already have an account) - only invited email addresses will have access.</p>
    <p><strong>If you have any problems accessing the Slack group, please get in touch via email so we can help you to troubleshoot.</strong></p>
    <p>Once you have logged in, read the information on the 'Getting Started' page (see screenshot below), then close it - you do not need to follow any of set up instructions.</p>

  <div id="name" class="left">
    <h3>Editing your name</h3>
    <p>To edit your profile, click the profile button on the top right of the screen, then click 'Edit Profile'.</p>
    <img src=".\images\menu-edit-profile.PNG" alt="profile menu screenshot" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Change both the 'Full Name' and the 'Display Name' to your child's <strong>first name and second initial</strong>. Do not fill in any of the additional information.</p>

    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="picture" class="left">
    <h3>Changing your picture</h3>
    <p>If your email address is linked to other accounts, you may have a profile picture by default.</p>
    <p>Click 'Remove' under the picture to remove it or, if it is not possible to remove it, replace it with a <strong>neutral or abstract (non-identifying and child-appropriate)</strong> picture, such as shapes or animals.</p>
    <p>Right-click here to download a <a href="blank-profile.png" target="_blank">blank profile picture</a>.</p>
    <p>If your child would like a profile picture, please use the same guidelines to help them to choose one before the workshop.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="notifications" class="left">
    <h3>Disabling email notifications</h3>
    <p>By default, you will get an email notification whenever a response is made to one of your posts.</p>
    <p>You can turn this off by clicking on 'CCC - Code Adventure' in the top left, then clicking 'Preferences'.</p>
    <img src=".\images\menu-preferences.PNG" alt="preferences menu screenshot" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Scroll all the way to the end of the notifications menu, and untick the box.</p>
    <img src=".\images\stop-notifications.PNG" alt="turn off notifications screenshot" width="1000px" height="auto">
    <p>You child will still get notifications within Slack when their messages have been responded to.</p>
    <p>You can also change other settings from this menu, for example change the colour scheme and accessibility options.</p>
    <br>
  </div>

  <div id="using" class="left">
    <h3>Using the channels</h3>
    <p>Each 'channel' has a different purpose, which will help to keep discussions on track throughout the day.</p>
    <p><strong>Before the day of the workshop, you and your child can post in #hello channel, to introduce yourself (remember, do not share any identifying information!) and to practice using Slack.</strong></p>
    <p>You can also use the #technical-help channel if you need some help using Slack.</p>
    <p>All of the group channels will be monitored by Science Oxford staff during the workshop. We will respond to requests for help, and make suggestions for expanding projects.</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Once you have completed the set-up, please log out of Slack on shared computers and do not allow your child to use it unaccompanied. It will not be fully monitored until the day of the workshop.</strong></p>
