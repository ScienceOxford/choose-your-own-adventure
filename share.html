    <p>This will save it on your computer - possibly in your downloads folder.</p>
    <p>In Slack, go to the <strong>#showcase channel</strong> and begin a new post to let us know that you are sharing your story.</p>
    <p>On the right-hand side of your post, click the paperclip icon to attach your story. Click 'Your computer' to choose your file.</p>

    <h3>Viewing other Stories</h3>
    <p>In Slack, the uploaded stories are code - you cannot read the story the way the author means you to.</p>
    <p>To view a story properly, you first need to download it. Hover over the post, then click the download icon.</p>
    <img src=".\images\download-story.PNG" alt="download file screenshot" width="600px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>This will save their story to your computer, possibly in your downloads folder. Find the new file and open it, you should now be able to read it.</p>
    <p>Test it out, trying out a few different branches, and leave them a comment to let them know that you have read it!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you think of their story?</li>
      <li>Have they added any cool features?</li>
      <li>Did anything unexpected happen?</li>
    </ul>
