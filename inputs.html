    <h1>Allow your reader to customise the story</h1>
    <p>You can use inputs to allow your reader to e.g. give the character a name.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Creating a set-up passage.</h3>
    <p>Asking your reader to input information pops up a box over your story - it does not work neatly within your paragraph.</p>
    <img src=".\images\dialog-box.PNG" alt="example dialog box screenshot" width="600px" height="auto">
    <p>To keep the flow of the story, you can start your story with a new passage, that asks your reader for their name before the story officially starts.</p>
    <p>Click the <strong>+Passage</strong> button on the bottom left to create a new, unconnected, passage.</p>
    <p>Copy and paste the below code into this passage, then close the passage.</p>
    <pre>(set: $name to (prompt: "Hello, what is your name?", ""))
Welcome to the story $name!</pre>
    <br>
    <p>This does a few things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sets a new variable <code>$name</code></li>
      <li>Uses a <code>prompt</code> to ask the reader for some information</li>
      <li>Uses the newly created variable in a sentence</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Test out the code by hovering over the passage, and clicking the play button.</strong></p>
    <img src=".\images\play-passage.PNG" alt="finding the play button on a passage screenshot" width="400px" height="auto">
    <br>
    <p>Edit the code so that it fits your story.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you want the pop up to say?</li>
      <li>What happens when you put something inside the blank speech marks <code>""</code> at the end of the first line?</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h3>Step 2: Connect this passage to your story</h3>
    <p>Once you have finished writing your passage, you can connect it to the start of your story.</p>
    <p>To do this, you need to know the <strong>title</strong> of your opening passage, in my example it is <code>Beginning</code>.</p>
    <p>Instead of asking the reader to click on a box called <code>Beginning</code>, I am going to call my link something else, but <strong>point it</strong> to the correct passage.</p>
    <pre>[[Start your Adventure ->Beginning]]</pre>
    <br>
    <p>Add the code to your passage, and edit it so that <code>Beginning</code> is the title of <strong>your</strong> first passage.</p>
    <p>Check that your set-up passage now has an arrow linking it to your story.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, you need to change the official start of your story to your new set-up passage.</p>
    <p>Hover over the passage, and click the three dots <code>...</code> to access the menu. Click <strong>Start Story Here</strong>. The green rocket will now be on the top left corner of the passage.</p>

    <br>
    <p><strong>If you have asked your reader for their name, you should use it in your story! Look through all of your paragraphs, and add <code>$name</code> to put their name into the text.</strong></p>
    <p>What other questions could you ask your reader? How will you use this information throughout your story?</p>
